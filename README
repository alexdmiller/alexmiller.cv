```
npm install
node build-cv.js src/cv.yaml > output.html; open output.html
```

TODO
- just organized files into appropriate places, need to update scripts so they will output the correct paths etc.
- Also need to copy the contents of the gallery into the build folder.
- Figure out how to use google drive to publish (use the API?)
