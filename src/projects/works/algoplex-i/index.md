_Algoplex I_ is an interactive installation that presents the viewer with an opportunity to explore an algorithmic playground using a custom made controller – the "Light Cube". As users twist and turn the Light Cube, the cube and projected visuals react with light and sound changes.

Presented at Lusio Light Festival 2017, Seattle Art Museum Remix 2019, Glass Box Gallery 2019.
