An interactive installation at the [Museum of Museums](https://www.museumofmuseums.com/) in Seattle. One part whimsical arcade game, one part secret laboratory experiment. Viewers tap buttons that control the life and death of algorithmically generated organisms. Too little interaction, and the creatures remain dull and stagnant. Too much prodding, and the creatures reproduce explosively, eventually overcrowding their container and dying.
